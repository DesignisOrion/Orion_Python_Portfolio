# Project 1: CNN News Scraper
- Created a tool that scrapes the current news events from CNN News Feed.

# Details
- This scraper allows you to extract the title, link and publishing date.
- Library used was BeautifulSoup4
- Module used was urllib for handling modules to request the rss feed.
 

## Reason behind project
- I wanted to make a news feed scraper for CNN to learn more about BeautifulSoup4 and urllib. I was able to understand how BeautifulSoup4 allows the data to be extacted to be extracted. The urllib was also learned of it's modules such as requests and urlopen.
